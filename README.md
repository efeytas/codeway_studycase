This is Instagram Story Clone.

Features:

* Users are sorted based on whether all of their stories have been viewed or not. In the mock data, the 5th user is placed at the beginning of the list because not all of their stories have been viewed.
* When holding down on the stories, they pause, and when released, they continue.
* Swiping to the right or left changes the user.
* Tapping to the right or left enables the transition between stories.
* If a story has been watched, its viewed status changes, and when opening users' stories, the unviewed stories are opened first (1st user's data is an example of this).
* There is a Cubic transition between users.

Depending on internet speed, there might be delays in loading the stories.
